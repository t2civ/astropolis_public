# Everything here works on the main thread! NOT THREADSAFE!

# We use I, Voyager's selection system almost as is. This extended class adds
# methods for making Facility and Proxy selections (static for camera access).
#
# For facility selection: 
#   name              = Facility.name
#   gui_name          = Facility.gui_name (something like 'Moon / NASA')
#   up_selection_name = Body.name
#
# As above for proxy (body/polity) selection.
#
# TODO: Depreciate unused 'is_body' and 'spatial' in base I, Voyager class?
