# Real-world data on the right is not used directly, but transformed into simplified game terms.												
# Space tax is a made-up concept where a space agency taxes private activity off the homeworld. It starts at 0% and can be raised later.												
# Private Sector GDP --(tax)--> Govt --(space_agency_support)--> Space Agency; Private Sector Space GDP --(space_tax)--> Space Agency												
# The local player can control a space agency or space company at game start, and later an independent. An independent will be a new PLAYER_CLASS_IND_GOVT/PLAYER_CLASS_IND_PRIVATE pair.												
# For computer players, private sectors are profit motivated, while public sectors may act with more abstract goals.												
# Public sector has taxing juristiction over their respective private sector and provide policing and other public services.												
# Investment (i.e., debt) flows relatively freely among private sector players if there are no sanctions.

# Above gives US space budget equivilant to 0.89% of total federal tax on GDP, which is better than true NASA share of budget 0.49%. We take full space budget here as NASA for game simplfication.
