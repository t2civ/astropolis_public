# Notes on table meanings & derivations

ooma = "out of my ..." (my unsupported and uninformed guesses)

Some numbers are researched and others are ooma placeholders just to get the sim running. Suggested fixes (with references!) are most welcome!

For data related to Earth's nations and populations our target year is ~2010. We'll run the sim for ~10 years to have actual game start around ~2020. This will fill our simulation history (graphs, last-four-quarters financials, etc.) for GUI display. It will also help us tune our simulation parameters to roughly approximate more contemporary data.

## Incomplete list of abstrations (intentionally unrealistic elements)
* ESA is treated as a space agency of the EU.
* "CNSA" is a conflation of CNSA and CASC; NASA is in some places conflated with its contractors; etc.
* Resource groupings "Industrial Metals", "Xenon/Krypton", etc. Substances of unique importance in the simulation are singular. (We do have conservation of mass, very roughly speaking.)
* Ores always have the same percent target metal or mineral. E.g., Iron ores are 70%  iron; precious metal ores are 1% precious metals, etc. We assume benification occurs at the mine to produce exactly consistent "ore" commodities.

## facilities.tsv

Name construction: FACILITY_<body_name>_<player_name>

There is at most one "facility" for each player at each body, which combines all of that player's activity. 

The table has game start only. We have one "homeworld" facility for each player on Earth, plus four at SPACECRAFT_ISS (one each for NASA, Roscosmos, ESA & JAXA) and one at SPACECRAFT_TIANGONG (CNSA).

#### public_portion
Fraction of facility that is public sector. For small facilities, generally 1.0 for space agencies and 0.0 for private companies. For Earth "homeworld" facilities representing polities, values follow roughly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_sector_size:


|             | 2010 (%)       | 2020 (%)       |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| USA         | 13.3           | 13.3           |
| Russia      | 40.6           | 40.6           |
| China       | 30 (guess)     | 25             |
| EU          | 18 (see below) | 18 (see below) |
| India       | 3.8            | 3.8            |
| Japan       | 7.7            | 7.7            |
| Other       | 20 (guess)     | 20 (guess)     |


We mainly use ILO estimates, or best guess what it would be in ~2010 and ~2020. EU is set between Germany (12.9) & France (20.5), leaning to the latter. 

#### internal_market

If set, internal operations are treated as separate entities for taxation and economic activity measurement. I.e., all resources produced & used are sales & purchases. True for "ports" and larger facilities, false for smaller facilities. We assume the ISS's solar panels produce ecectricty for its own operation, while "USA" solar panels produce electricity sold to other domestic entities.

#### solar_occlusion

Overrides Body.solar_occlusion if specified. These are set to give observed (or guessed) solar power utilizations (="capacity factor") for polity "homeworld facilities". See facilities_operations_utilizations.tsv/SOLAR_POWER below.

## facilities_operations_capacities.tsv

Row prefix: OPERATION_  
Column prefix: FACILITY_  
Table is transposed internally, access: table[facility_type][operation_type]  
Values are "operation units" defined in operations.tsv. For energy generation, this is 1 MW; for refining and manufacturing, 1 t/d total mass conversion; for extraction, deposits_percent/100 t/d ore extraction. Others are more abstract. Capacity is "peak" operation potential. Capacity x utilization = operation_rate.

#### SOLAR_POWER
World GWp (=capacity): ~40 in 2010, ~640 in 2019, ~1000 in 2022, roughly from charts at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power.

2016 & 2020 from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country:

|             | 2010 (MW) | 2016 (MW) | 2020 (MW) |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| USA         | 5260      | 40,300    | 75,572    |
| Russia      | 10        | 77        | 1,428     |
| China       | 10,189    | 78,070    | 254,355   |
| EU          | 13,238    | 101,433   | 152,917   |
| India       | 1176      | 9,010     | 39,211    |
| Japan       | 5579      | 42,750    | 67,000    |
| Other       | 4549      | 34,860    | 123,487   |

2016 other is 306,500 minus listed polities; 2020 other is 713,970 minus listed polities.  
2010 "guesses" are proportionate to 2016 with total equal to ~40,000 for the world.


ISS solar power is 75-90 kw: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/facts-and-figures. Per wiki this is USOS segment. I'm assuming this is peak (not average) so we use high end (0.09 MW) for our capacity. Utilization is 50% for this orbit.  
Zvezda (Roscosmos segment) has its own power; ooma 0.03 MW.  
Tiangong ooma: 0.04 MW.

#### WIND_POWER

## facilities_operations_utilizations.tsv

Row prefix: OPERATION_  
Column prefix: FACILITY_  
Table is transposed internally, access: table[facility_type][operation_type]  
Internally, we convert utilization to rates (rate = capacity x utilization), then convert back to utilization(%) for GUI.

utilization = ["capacity factor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor)

For renewables, utilization is environmentally determined. For solar, we calculate based on distance to sun and solar_occlusion (or really, solar_occlusion was back-calculated to give actual utilization). For other renewables, initial utilization set in table is maintained and never changes.

For most other operations, utilization can be set manually or automated. Automation attempts to deal with projected internal usage, shortages and commitments, or (otherwise) maximize profitable operations and minimize unprofitable.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_renewable_energy_topics_by_country_and_territory

#### SOLAR_POWER

Can't find one source that gives estimations of solar power generation! (Or any source for some countries...)

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor:  
USA: 25.1 - 26.1% (for PV, the majority); ~22% for CSP  
UK : 5.1 - 11.8%, average ~9%

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_United_States, PV (utility) 24.6%, PV (small scale) 17%, Thermal 20.5%.

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_the_European_Union:  
"In 2011 the EU's solar electricity production is evaluated as ca 44.8 TWh in 2011 with 51.4 GW installed capacity." From this we get 9.94% utilization. It would be nice to have a more recent estimation...

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_India, installed capacity was 39,083 MW as of Feb, 2021, and generation was 60.4 TWh from Apris 2020 to March 2021. From this we get 17.6% utilization.

Didn't find generation estimationS for China or Japan.

Combining above with some guesses:  
USA    24%  
Russia  8% (worse than EU I would think)  
China  20% (mainly in west; I guess better than EU, but not quite US)  
EU     10%  
India  17.6%  
Japan  14% (guess)  
Other  30% (my guess for an average; should be quite good w/ Australia, Africa, Middle East, etc...)  

For spacecraft in low Earth orbit: 50%.


#### WIND_POWER

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country, we use 2020-2021 energy production and 2020/2021 (average) capacity to calculate utilization for listed nations. We assume 2010 utlization is the same.

| | production (TWh) / capacity (MW) | x 1e6 MW/TW / (8766 h/yr) = | 
| ------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------|
| USA     | 384  / 125,241             | 0.350 (USA has great wind!)       |
| China   | 656  / 305,483             | 0.245                             |
| India   | 68.1 / 38,559              | 0.197                             |
| Russia  | ?                          | 0.2  (guess)                      |
| EU      | ?                          | 0.2  (guess; Europe is wind-poor) |
| Japan   | ?                          | 0.28 (guess; good offshore?)      |
| Other   | ?                          | 0.25 (low/middle of range)        |

For reference, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor lists values for:  
USA: ~32-37%, average ~34%
UK onshore: ~27-33%, average ~30%
UK offshore: ~26-41%, average ~35%
(But continental Europe is less than UK, I believe...)

#### TIDAL_POWER, HYDROPOWER

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor, typical values: 
Wave & tidal in UK: ~0-9%, average ~5% (is it really this bad?!) 
Hydro (US & UK): ~33-43%, average ~38%

#### GEOTHERMAL_POWER (TODO)

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor, USA ~73-77%, average ~75%.

## compositions.tsv

Compositions define all of the extractable resources in the solar system. Internally, 'Composition' is a data structure attached to a Body that defines resources for one 'stratum'. Strata correspond to both physical/geophysical structures and also practictical accessibility (on Earth this includes political boundaries). 

Composition names are constructed:
COMPOSITION_<body_name or generic body_class>_<stratum_name>[_<owner_name>]

Field comments:
\#volume, #mass: for info/QA only; internal values are calculated.
thickness: if blank, imputed to be Body.m_radius.

#### PLANET_EARTH_STRATUM_ATMOSPHERE

Mass 5.15e18 kg. 3/4 mass under 11 km. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth.  
Surface area of Earth: 5.10e8 km\^2.  
We arbitrarily set thickness to include mesosphere at 82 km, then calculate:  
Volume 5.10e8 km\^2 x 82 km = 4.18e10 km\^3  
Density 5.15e18 kg / (4.18e10 km\^3 x 1e9 km\^3/m\^3)  
   =0.123 kg/m\^3 = 1.23e-4 g/cm\^3

#### PLANET_EARTH_STRATUM_OCEAN
Mass of hydrosphere 1.386e18 t, of which 97.5% (=1.351e18 t) is ocean. Area is
3.61e8 km^2. Density of seawater 1020 to >1050 kg/m^3 (=1.02 to >1.05 g/cm^3).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater
We use 1.03 g/cm^3 density. We calculate average depth:
1.351e21 kg / (1030 kg/m^3 * 1e9 m^3/km^3 * 3.61e8 km^2) = 3.633 km
Volume 3.61e8 km^2 * 3.633 km = 1.31e9 km^3
Content:
We consider 3.5% salt as "Industrial Minerals".
Disolved gasses: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean)

Nitrogen: 9 mL/kg; x1.25 kg/m3 / (1e6  mL/m3) -> 1.1e-3%
Oxygen: 5 mL/kg; x1.429 kg/m3 / (1e6  mL/m3  -> 7.1e-4%

Arbitrarily set at 100m depth for mining potential (aka Hoover it up!):
https://oceanminingintel.com/insights/ocean-mining-the-5-minute-what-why-where-how-and-who

#### PLANET_EARTH_STRATUM_\<crust layers>
Layers arbitrarily defined for extraction potential, considering deepest:
 - pit mining: 1.2 km, but usually < 1 km. Conveniently, average continental
               altitude is 800 m. So we use that for "surface".
 - mining:     ~4 km. Gets really tough below, but maybe we could go to 8 km
               with some wild engineering.
 - drilling:   ~7.5 km (? check wiki).
So we have strata for player exploitation as:
 - CONT_SURFACE: -0.8 - 0 km (pit mining)
 - CONT_SUBSURF: 0 - 4 km (mining)
 - CONT_4KM_8KM: 4 - 8 km (drilling, but maybe mining with tech)
And deeper strata not currently accessible:
 - CONT_8KM_28KM: 8 - 28 km
 - LOWER_CONT_CRUST: 28 - 40 km
 
Our simplified Earth structure model:
 - Ocean Crust: 7.5 km (real world 5-10 km)
 - Upper Continental Crust: Surface - 28 km
 - Lower Continental Crust: 28-40 km
 (that's all we need for now...)

Notes on upper/lower continental crust: There is a Conrad
discontinuity at 15-20 km and "sima starts about 11 km below the Conrad
discontinuity". The sial/sima transition is all about chemistry and
density, so that is where we define the upper/lower transition.

Unowned part of continental surface is Antarctica (area 1.42e7 km^2). Subract
Antarctica and 6 major players from total land area (1.49e8 km^2) gets us area
of PLAYER_OTHER at 9.03e7 km^2.

## operations.tsv

Operations define most of the things that "happen" on bodies with facilities,
mainly involving resource extraction and conversion. Operations are allowed by
Modules.
 
Internally in the 'Operations' object we have arrays 'capacities' and 'rates'.
We are at 100% utilization when rate == capacity. 

"One unit of capacity" is defined by op_class:
 ENERGY        - 1 MW electrical output (ie, MWe)
 EXTRACTION    - deposits/100 t/d extracted ore
 BIOME         - 1 km^2 equivilant Earth area
 REFINING      - 1 t/d total mass conversion (=input or output, always same)
 MANUFACTURING - 1 t/d total production (= mass conversion as above)
 SERVICES      - 1 unit/d of whatever intangible resource(s) is(are) produced

#### SOLAR_POWER, WIND_POWER, TIDAL_POWER, HYDROPOWER

Capacity unit is 1 GW by definition. Utilization is subject to the environment.
See comments in facilities_operations_utilizations.tsv.
For solar, utilization is a function of disance from sun and solar_occlusion (from bodies.tsv or override value from facilities.tsv).
For other renewables, table value in facilities_operations_utilizations.tsv never changes.

#### OIL_POWER

#### IRON_MINING_, INDUST_METALS_MINING, PRECIOUS_METALS_MINING_

Source for energy/t for gold, copper, nickle, iron (download pdf report):  
https://www.ceecthefuture.org/resources/mining-energy-consumption-2021
Iron magnetite:
0.3 GJ/t ore(!)
41% mining
43% comminution
16% other processing
Iron hematite:
0.15 GJ/t ore(!)
90% mining
10% processing
Copper:
24 GJ/t final copper (average)
60% mining
36% comminution (grinding/milling)
4% other processing (smelting???)
Nickel (leach):
244 GJ/t final nickle (average)
59% mining
29% comminution
12% other processing
Lithium:
15 GJ/t hydroxide (I think)
48% mining
47% comminution
5% other processing
Gold (underground, higher grade):
130,000 GJ/t unrefined gold bars
45% mining
26% comminution
29% other processing

The reason for the 6-orders-of-magnitude differences above is due mainly to differences in ore deposits. Rougly speaking, 500,000x more mining/comminution is needed to get a tonne of gold ore versus a tonne of iron ore. We simulate that by having extraction rate multiplied by "known deposits" level, with Earth deposits: ~33% (iron), 0.033% (indust metal), 1e-4% (precious metals).

Note: We tweeked compositions to give above deposits. If this gives us wrong total masses, we can re-adjust compositions and tweek energies here.

For all but iron, "other processing" is smelting (converting ore to metal). We use average of the two iron ores, and use nickle and gold as our proxies for industrical and precious metals.
  
1 MWh = 3.6 GJ.
1 GJ/t at 1 t/d, x 1/3.6 MWh/GJ x 1/24 d/h = 1.157e-2 MW
For ops power, multiply above by the ore's power consumption (above) and the ore's typical Earth deposits fraction (from Compositions values). 

For iron mining (1 t/d ore extraction):
0.22 GJ/t x 0.33 -> 8.49e-4 MW

For industrial metals mining (using 88% of Nickel power above):
215 GJ/t -> 0.828 MW

For precious metal ores (using 71% of Gold power above, x 1000 kg/t):
102,700 GJ/t -> 396 MW



****BIOME****

URBAN_DEVELOPED
Allows 20000 humans / km^2, which is about the density of Paris proper:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density
In 2010 & 2020, 51% & 56% of humans were "urban":
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population

For game start facility values, we assume urban capacity is 2x its present
inhabitants (which is ~50% of total population).
'rate' is n/a for this operation.
TODO: Mechanism to grow urban capacity.

SMALL_FOOD_FARMING
Allows 100 humans / km^2. Capacity is ~1x total population.
All private sector (is this way off for Russia, China?).




*******************************************************************************
modules.tsv
*******************************************************************************
Modules (mostly) represent real physical components (e.g., a nuclear plant) and
(mostly) have integral quantities. But we can have different modules that allow
the same Operation in different contexts, each with its own 'op_quantity'. So,
for example, we can have small portable nuclear reactors appropriate for small
space facilities. (But some of this gets a little weird with service economy
and intangible resources.)

See "one operation unit" as defined for different op classes (above).



For power generators, 1 module -> 1 GJ/d at 100% capacity. For most others,
1 module -> 1 t/d of mass converted at 100% capacity.

*******************************************************************************
Amounts are the rate that one "module" can process in tonnes per day, using or
producing power in GJ/d. We drop /d here to do all calculations in t and GJ.
Module is abstract but most modules will involve conversion of 1.0 t/d of
material or production of 1000 GJ/d energy). Fractional modules are allowed so
we aren't setting minumums here.
Table field 'power' is positive for production and negative for useage.


1 MWh = 3.6 GJ
1 MW = 86.4 GJ/d
1e6 Btu = 1.06 GJ
1 ton = 0.907 tonne (t)

PROCESS_SOLAR_POWER
power = 1000 GJ/d is for in-space unshaded at 1 AU.
Earth surface has 'is_local' solar power multiplier of x 0.25.

PROCESS_COAL_COMBUSTION
Typical "bituminous" coal: 84.4% C, 5.4% H2, 6.7% O2, 1.8% S, 1.7% N2;
Energy density 24 MJ/kg, for 40% efficiency, "325 kg will power 100 W for yr";
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal
0.325t/100Wyr x 1yr/365.25d x 10^6W/MW x 1MWd/86.4GJ -> 103 t coal/1000 GJ
Combustion:
(84% C) C + O2 -> CO2; mws 12.011 + 31.998 -> 44.009
(5.4% H2) 2 H2 + O2 -> 2 H2O; mws 4.032 + 31.998 -> 36.03
(1.8% S) S + O2 -> SO2; mws 32.06 + 31.998 -> 64.058
(1.7% N2) N2 -> N2 (ignoring NOx)
(6.7% O2) Assume cobusted so deduct from O2 input
Per 103 t coal,
86.5 C (in coal) + 230.5 O2 -> 317 CO2
5.56 H2 (in coal) + 44.1 O2 -> 49.7 H2O
1.85 S (in coal) + 1.85 O2 -> 3.70 SO2
6.90 O2 (in coal) - 6.90 O2 -> nothing
	-> + 1000 GJ power
t per 1000 GJ: 103 coal + 269 O2 -> 317 CO2 + 49.7 H2O + 3.70 SO2 + 1.75 N2
We could balance mass with 'ash' product if we want to go there.
This is close to wiki CO2 emmisions data: 1001 g CO2/kWh;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation
1001g/kWh x 10^-6t/g x 1e6kWh/3600 GJ -> 278 t CO2/1000 GJ

PROCESS_OIL_COMBUSTION
We're simplifying and burning oil directly rather than processing to fuel oil.
84% C, 12% H2, 3% S, 1% O2, 1% N2
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum
Specific energy ~42 versus ~30 of Coal (1.4x)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density
Ajusting totals from Coal (in t),
t per 1000 GJ: 73.6 oil + 197 O2 -> 226 CO2 + 78.9 H2O + 1.47 SO2 + 0.735 N2
(Assuming 40% efficiency. Is this ok?)

PROCESS_REFINED_FUELS_COMBUSTION
Specific energy gasoline 46.4, kerosene 43 MJ/kg;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density
For octane, 1kg C8H18 + 3.51kg O2 -> 3.09kg CO2 + 1.42kg H20
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline
If we use S.E. 44 MJ/kg, we have (in t):
t per 1000 GJ: 70.3 fuel + 247 O2 -> 217 CO2 + 99.8 H20
(Assuming 40% efficiency. Is this ok?)

PROCESS_ETHANOL_COMBUSTION
Specific energy 30 MJ/kg HHV
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density
C2H5OH + 3 O2 -> 2 CO2 + 3 H2O; mws 46.069 + 95.994 -> 88.018 + 54.045
t per 1000 GJ: 103 ethanol + 214 O2 -> 197 CO2 + 121 H2O
(Assuming 40% efficiency. Is this ok?)

PROCESS_METHANE_COMBUSTION
Specific energy 55.6 MJ/kg HHV (natural gas 53.6)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density
CH4 + 2 O2 -> CO2 + 2 H2O; mws 16.043 + 63.996 -> 44.009 + 36.03
t per 1000 GJ: 55.6 methane + 222 O2 -> 153 CO2 + 125 H2O
This is close to wiki CO2 emmisions data: natural gas 669 g CO2/kWh,
-> 186 t CO2/1000 GJ
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation

PROCESS_HYDROGEN_COMBUSTION
Specific energy 141.86 MJ/kg HHV (assuming recondensing of H2O,
BUT does not consider heating liquid H2 to gas)
2 H2 + O2 -> 2 H2O; mws 4.032 + 31.998 -> 36.03
t per 1000 GJ: 21.8 H2 + 173 O2 -> 195 H2O

PROCESS_FISSION
Our proxy "fission fuel" is yellowcake.
Total yellowcake volume for 2020 was 92 million lb;
https://www.yellowcakeplc.com/uranium-market/
Total nuclear power supplied in 2019 was 2,586 TWh
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power
96e6 lbs/2586 TWh x 1 TWh/3.6e6 GJ x 1kg/2.20462 lbs -> 0.00468 kg/GJ
-> 4.68 kg / 1000 GJ
Assume 90% used for power, so 5.20 kg yellowcake / 1000 GJ power.

PROCESS_METALS_MINING
Most metals mines have some industrial metal as main product (by mass) and may
or may not have precious metal as secondary product (by mass), even if the
precious metal is the main economic value. So these mines are really industrial
metals mines with bonus precious metals.
Copper/Lead&Zinc Recovery ratios: 0.16%/8% (we use 1.5%)
Gold & Silver Recovery ratios: 0.001%
Metals Btu/Ton mined: 342,200
